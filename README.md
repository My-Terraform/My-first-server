For Creating and deploying your first EC2 instance on aws just perform following activities.

1. Create terraform file with .tf extention. I have already added it. Refer Deploy.tf
2. Declare provider. In our case it is EC2
3. Declare resource
4. copy the instance ID according to your region

To Run use following command:
